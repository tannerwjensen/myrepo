## Reading Notes

- A variable is categorical if it can only take one of a small set of values. 

- A variable is continuous if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values.

- Typical values are easy to interpret and visualize; Unusual values are outliers and easy to identify in a graph. 

- The mutate() and ifelse() functions can be used to replace unusual or missing values (as NA) without having to delete the entire row.

- Covariation is the tendancy for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. 

- Density is the count standardised so that the area under each frequency polygon is one. 

- A boxplot is a type of visual shorthand for a distribution of values. 

- Various geometric functions can be used to clean up the data (geom_count, geom_tile, geom_point, geom_histogram, etc). 

## EDA Example

The code below is an example of the EDA process using the `starwars` data from the `tidyverse` package. (Make sure you have the `tidyverse` package installed!)

Run the code line-by-line and look at the output. Add a comment to each line of code that explains what it does/what insights it provides.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #Imports tidyverse 

dim(starwars) #Dim function sets the dimension of the specific matrix 
colnames(starwars) #Creates separate columns for each of the variables

head(starwars) #Displays  the first n rows present in input data
glimpse(starwars) #Similar to a print statement but displays data running down a page

?starwars #Gives an explanation regarding the starwars data set

starwars %>% count(species) #Counts the number of species in the starwars data set 

mean(starwars$height) #Calculates the average height of starwars characters in the data set
mean(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE) #Calculates the average height of starwars characters in the data set, but excludes values with NA from the calculation.

summary(starwars$height) #Five-number-summary of the character heights in the data set

cm_to_ft <- function(cm){
  ft = cm / 30.48
  return(ft)
} #Converts the centimeters to feet for future calculations

starwars_2 <- starwars %>% mutate(height_ft = cm_to_ft(height)) #Creates copy of original data set for calculation of character height using feet instead of centimeters

dim(starwars_2) #Sets dimention of matrix of new data set
colnames(starwars_2) # Creates separate columns for each of the variables in the new data set

summary(starwars_2$height_ft) #Five-number-summary of the new starwars data set

ggplot(starwars_2, aes(height_ft)) + 
  geom_histogram() #Creates a ggplot using the heights in feet with the number of occurances 

starwars_2 %>% filter(height_ft == max(height_ft)) #Realigns the data with all respective variables
starwars_2 %>% filter(height_ft == max(height_ft, na.rm = TRUE)) #Displays the character Yarael Poof and it's respective variable information 

# https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yarael_Poof
```

## EDA Practice

Continue exploring the `starwars` data to gain additional insights, using [R4DS: Chapter 7](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) as a guide.

It is ok if you don't understand the all code in Chapter 7. (That is what we'll be learning the next two weeks!) If writing your own code is a struggle, try the "copy, paste, and tweak" method.

```{r}
# your code goes here
