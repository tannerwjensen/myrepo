Question 1: 

How do average temperatures affect state gdp per capita?

This topic interests me beacuase I've always wondered if peoples in colder climates are mentally tougher and therefore harder working. This question comes from the classic idea that tough times make tough people.

Question 2: 

Does the number or highways in a state mean there are more accidents per capita?

I thought of this question wondering if having more roadways with higher speed limits would cause there to be more accidents. My initial guess would be yes because people driving faster might lead to a greater margin of error in safe driving at high speeds.

Question 3: 

Do coastal states have higher crime rates per capita than non-coastal states?

My reason for asking this question is in regards to how people often smuggle illegal goods through international ports. My guess would be that coastal states would have a higher crime rate per capita.
